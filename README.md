# Fundamental_of_Python
## heory 1: Python
Python is a popular programming language that is easy to read and write. It is widely used for various tasks like web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Python doesn't require compilation and has a large community of developers contributing to its growth. It is known for its simplicity and versatility.

## Theory 2: File Handling
File handling involves working with files on a computer. In Python, you can open, read from, write to, and manipulate files using built-in functions. The open() function is used to open files, and you can specify whether you want to read, write, or append to a file.

## Theory 3: Exception Handling
Exception handling is about dealing with errors or unexpected events that can happen during program execution. In Python, when an error occurs, it raises an exception. You can use the try-except block to handle exceptions. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the except block is where you handle the exception.

## Theory 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming is a way of organizing code. It revolves around objects, which are like containers holding both data and functions. Objects are created from classes, which define their structure and behavior. OOP allows for code reusability, making it easier to maintain and update programs. It also emphasizes encapsulation, keeping the inner details of objects hidden.
## Topic 1: Basic Input and Output
This notebook contains 11 simple Python problems related to basic input and output operations. It covers topics like using the print function, arithmetic operators, area calculations, swapping values, and more.

## Topic 2: Conditional Statements
This notebook contains 21 Python problems focused on conditional statements. There are three important conditional statements you should know: the if statement, the if-else statement, and the if-elif-else ladder. These problems will help you practice using conditional statements in Python.

## Topic 3: Looping Statements
This notebook consists of 26 Python problems related to looping statements. It covers three types of loops: the for loop, which is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or string), the while loop, which executes a set of statements as long as a condition is true, and the nested loop, where a loop exists inside the body of another loop.

## Topic 4: File Handling
This notebook contains 10 Python problems that focus on file handling. It covers creating, opening, closing, and performing various file operations like reading, writing, and appending information. File handling is an essential part of programming, and these problems will help you practice these operations in Python.

## Topic 5: Class and Object
This notebook includes 5 Python problems related to classes and objects. A class is a blueprint that defines properties and behaviors, while an object is an instance of a class with those properties and behaviors. You'll practice creating and working with classes and objects, understanding the difference between them.

## Topic 6: Inheritance
This notebook features 3 Python problems centered around inheritance. Inheritance allows you to define a class that inherits methods and properties from another class. The parent class, also known as the base class, is the class being inherited from, while the child class, or derived class, is the class that inherits from another class. You'll practice implementing inheritance concepts in Python.

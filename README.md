# Fundamental_of_Python
## heory 1: Python
Python is a popular programming language that is easy to read and write. It is widely used for various tasks like web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Python doesn't require compilation and has a large community of developers contributing to its growth. It is known for its simplicity and versatility.

## Theory 2: File Handling
File handling involves working with files on a computer. In Python, you can open, read from, write to, and manipulate files using built-in functions. The open() function is used to open files, and you can specify whether you want to read, write, or append to a file.

##Theory 3: Exception Handling
Exception handling is about dealing with errors or unexpected events that can happen during program execution. In Python, when an error occurs, it raises an exception. You can use the try-except block to handle exceptions. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the except block is where you handle the exception.

## Theory 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming is a way of organizing code. It revolves around objects, which are like containers holding both data and functions. Objects are created from classes, which define their structure and behavior. OOP allows for code reusability, making it easier to maintain and update programs. It also emphasizes encapsulation, keeping the inner details of objects hidden.
